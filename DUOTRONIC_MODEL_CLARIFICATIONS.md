# DUOTRONIC MODEL — CLARIFICATIONS

## Status of This Document

This document is **non-normative**.

It does not define, modify, extend, or reinterpret:

* TLU semantics
* the Duotronic Model
* any evaluation criteria or correctness conditions

If this document conflicts with either `TLU_WHITEPAPER.md` or `DUOTRONIC_MODEL.md`, those documents are authoritative.

This document exists solely to **constrain interpretation**.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to prevent misinterpretation of:

* the **Ternary Logic Unit (TLU)**, and
* the **Duotronic Model**

by explicitly enumerating **invalid readings**, **projection errors**, and **category mistakes** that arise when these documents are read outside their intended analytic frame.

This document introduces no new ideas.

---

## 2. What This Document Does

This document:

* narrows interpretive latitude
* invalidates common extrapolations
* closes off non-intended readings
* constrains downstream discussion

This document does **not**:

* justify the project
* advocate for ternary systems
* explain benefits
* propose future work
* defend against criticism

Misunderstanding addressed here is treated as reader error, not ambiguity in the source material.

---

## 3. What the Duotronic Model Is Not

The Duotronic Model is **not**:

* a hardware architecture
* a software architecture
* a system design
* a performance model
* a cost–benefit analysis
* a roadmap
* a proposal for adoption
* a theory of computation
* a general theory of multi-valued logic

The model does not describe *how* to build systems.
It describes **constraints on semantic preservation** when ternary logic is embedded in existing environments.

Any reading that treats the model as constructive rather than analytic is invalid.

---

## 4. What the TLU Is Not

The Ternary Logic Unit (TLU) is **not**:

* a ternary CPU
* a replacement for binary logic
* a general-purpose execution model
* an AI substrate
* a symbolic reasoning engine
* a cognitive system
* a proposal for new control planes
* an attempt to redefine computation

The TLU defines **bounded ternary semantics** and nothing more.

Binary execution remains authoritative for:

* control flow
* addressing
* invariants
* interoperability

Any interpretation that assigns the TLU a central or dominant role in system execution is invalid.

---

## 5. Invalid Interpretations (Non-Exhaustive)

The following interpretations are explicitly invalid:

* “This argues ternary logic is superior to binary logic.”
* “This proposes future ternary hardware platforms.”
* “This is an optimization argument.”
* “This is about performance.”
* “This is an AI or cognition claim.”
* “This is a path toward replacing CPUs.”
* “This predicts industry adoption.”
* “This is a manifesto.”

Statements of this form do not follow from the text and must not be attributed to it.

## 6. Common Projection Errors

The following projection errors are common among technically sophisticated readers:

### 6.1 Architectural Projection

Inferring architectural intent from semantic definition.

Semantic definition does not imply architectural direction.

---

### 6.2 Performance Projection

Assuming that semantic expressiveness implies efficiency gains.

No performance claim is made or implied.

---

### 6.3 Trajectory Projection

Inferring inevitability, roadmap, or long-term direction.

The project explicitly permits termination without replacement.

---

### 6.4 Generalization Projection

Assuming applicability beyond explicitly bounded domains.

Scope is narrow by design.

---

### 6.5 Motivational Projection

Inferring advocacy, dissatisfaction with binary systems, or ideological motivation.

The documents are neutral with respect to outcomes.

---

## 7. On “Meaning”, “Awareness”, and Semantics

The phrase *meaning-aware computing* appears in the TLU whitepaper.

In this context:

* **meaning** refers strictly to *explicit semantic propagation rules*
* **awareness** refers to *structural representation*, not cognition
* no claim is made regarding intent, understanding, or intelligence

The TLU does not model:

* human reasoning
* machine cognition
* symbolic understanding
* semantic interpretation in the philosophical sense

Any cognitive or philosophical reading of “meaning” is invalid.

---

## 8. Why This Is Not a Roadmap

Neither the Duotronic Model nor the TLU whitepaper defines:

* stages
* milestones
* future systems
* hardware plans
* deployment scenarios

The presence of evaluation criteria does not imply pursuit of those criteria.

The documents are complete without further development.

---

## 9. On Stopping

Termination of:

* the Duotronic Model, or
* the TLU proposal

requires no replacement, successor, or justification.

Stopping may occur due to:

* falsification
* redundancy
* non-utility
* environmental change
* loss of analytic value

Stopping is a **successful outcome** when justified.

---

## 10. Interpretive Priority

When reading this repository:

1. **TLU_WHITEPAPER.md** defines semantics and scope
2. **DUOTRONIC_MODEL.md** analyzes constraints
3. **Clarification documents** restrict interpretation

No external discussion, experiment, or implementation has authority to extend meaning beyond the text.

---

## 11. Closing Constraint

If a reader believes that these documents imply more than they explicitly state, that belief is incorrect.

The text is the boundary.
No inference beyond it is valid.
