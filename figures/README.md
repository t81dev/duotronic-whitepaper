# Figures (Conceptual, Non-Normative)

Figures in this repository are **conceptual**. They exist to clarify:
- layering (binary substrate vs ternary semantic layer),
- scope boundaries,
- evaluation framing.

They do **not** specify:
- instruction encodings,
- microarchitecture,
- timing/pipeline behavior,
- performance claims.

If a figure risks implying implementation details, it does not belong here.
